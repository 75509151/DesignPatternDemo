this is the sample for <head first design pattern>

-----------------Observer---------------
observer1: user  the <head first customize observer code>
observer2: user the Java sdk's internal observer code 

different between observer1 and observer2:

the update order is different, follow the sample code, the result is following:

observer1 result:
